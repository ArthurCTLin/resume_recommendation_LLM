# Resume Matcher with LLM & Embedding
This resume matcher helps HR professionals and recruiters efficiently identify candidates who best align with a given job description. By combining semantic understanding and AI-powered analysis, it goes beyond keyword matching to evaluate true fit.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The tool leverages a large language model (LLM) to analyze both the job description and resumes. It summarizes each document into five essential dimensions:
- **Experience & Achievements**
- **Skills & Competencies**
- **Culture Fit**
- **Personal Traits**
- **Education**

These structured summaries are then converted into embeddings. The tool calculates similarity scores across each of the five dimensions to provide a context-aware comparison between the job description and resumes.
